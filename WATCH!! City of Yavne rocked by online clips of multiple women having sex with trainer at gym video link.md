Video clips from a gym in Yavne, apparently gleaned from hacked security cameras at the premises and then shared online, have rocked the central Israel city, as footage reportedly showed female clients, including some who are married, having sex with a trainer.

The Israel Police said Tuesday that it had opened a probe into the hack and that two complaints were filed, one of them by the owner of the gym and the other by a woman who was at the gym.

Local residents in the city of just under 60,000 residents told media that the acts revealed in the footage have destroyed some families and left some husbands with nagging suspicions about their wives.


“How can I describe the shame I felt when I saw the clip?” a woman who spotted her aunt in a video asked the Walla news site. “Our family is ruined. People don’t understand the damage caused. It is not just clips. It destroyed entire families.”

Walla cited one resident of the city as saying: “The facts are that there were married women who cheated, some of them endangered the health of their husbands since they had unprotected sex with the trainer,” who also had intercourse with multiple other women.
